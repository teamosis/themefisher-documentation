Change logo from navigation section. In navigation section(which is located top of the template) you can find navbar-brand where you can change the logo image or pull your text on `logo` class.

```html
<!– logo –>
<div class="logo">
 <img src="img/Fiction-logo.png" alt="Logo">
</div>
<!– /logo –>
```
