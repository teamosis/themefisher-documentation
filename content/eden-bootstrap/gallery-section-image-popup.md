We have used magnific popup for this.

The markup is :

Change image **src** to change main image and **href=””** image to popup preview image.

```html
<div class="gallery-item">
	<a href="images/gallery/1-4.jpg" title="Photo 2">
	<img src="images/gallery/4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-100">
	</a>
</div>
```
