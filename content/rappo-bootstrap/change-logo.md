 Change logo from navigation section. In navigation section(which is located top of the template) you can find navbar-brand where you can change the logo image or pull your text on `a` tag.

```html
<a class="d-block" href="index.html">
  <img loading="lazy" src="images/logo.png" alt="Constra">
</a>
```
