- **Helpers** - Helpers are functional components designed to assist you in managing dynamic aspects of your layouts. 


- **Parials** - Partials allow you to reuse custom blocks or sections across different layouts. This feature is beneficial when you want to maintain consistency across multiple pages without duplicating code. 

- **Shortcodes** - Shortcodes enables you to add custom functionality to your content. With shortcodes, you can create dynamic and interactive elements directly within your markdown files.
