Change logo from navigation section. In navigation section(which is located top of the template) you can find navbar-brand where you can change the logo image or pull your text on `a` tag.

```html
<a class="navbar-brand d-lg-none" href="index.html">
  <img src="images/logos/footer-logo.png" alt="">
</a>
```
