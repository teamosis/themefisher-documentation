**It’s always smart to start by reviewing the changelog for the update.** This is the best way to get a high level snapshot of the changes to inform your update strategy.

Your update should begin with replacing the old compiled CSS and JS with the newer versions. Continue by reviewing to see if there are any changes to HTML structure or the classes used in the CSS or JS that you need to account for. If you run into issues, using a diff tool to review changes between the previous and latest versions of a file can help pinpoint the change causing issues.
