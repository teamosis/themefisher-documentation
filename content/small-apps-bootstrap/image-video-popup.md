We have used [fancybox 3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) for popup video and images. You can popup your image/video by adding `data-fancybox` in your any `a` tag and can provide the link of your video/image in `href` attribute.

```html
<a data-fancybox href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opj24KnzrWo">
 <i class="tf-ion-play video"></i>
</a>
```

For more details you can see the [documentation](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/) of fancybox 3.
