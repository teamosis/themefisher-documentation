If you want to customize the layouts, you can do it from the `src/layouts` directory.

This directory contains essential files and subdirectories that govern the overall appearance and structure of your website.

- **Components** - Astro provides a selection of built-in components that simplify the process of creating and managing elements within your layouts.

- **Helpers** - Helpers are components that help you manage the dynamic aspects of your layouts.

- **Parials** - Partials allow you to reuse custom blocks or sections across different layouts. This feature is beneficial when you want to maintain consistency across multiple pages without duplicating code.

- **Shortcodes** - Shortcodes enables you to add custom functionality to your content. With shortcodes, you can create dynamic and interactive elements directly within your markdown files.

> **Note:** If you want to use shortcodes in your content, you will need to create `.mdx` file. Astro doesn't support shortcodes in `.md` file.
