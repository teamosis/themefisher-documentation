# Themefisher Docs

Documentation site for [themefisher](https://docs.themefisher.com).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Hugo of any kind including documentation, suggestions, bug reports, pull requests etc.  We would love to hear from you.

Note that this repository contains solely the documentation for themefisher website themes .

*Pull requests shall **only** contain changes to the actual documentation. However, changes on the code base of Hugo **and** the documentation shall be a single, atomic pull request in the [themefisher](https:docs.themefisher.com) repository.*

Spelling fixes are most welcomed, and if you want to contribute longer sections to the documentation, it would be great if you had the following criteria in mind when writing:

* Short is good. People go to the library to read novels. If there is more than one way to *do a thing*.
* For example, try to find short snippets that teaches people about the concept. If the example is also useful as-is (copy and paste), then great. Don't list long and similar examples just so people can use them on their sites.
